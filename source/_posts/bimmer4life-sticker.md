A sticker that speaks for itself. Made by bimmer drivers. Made for bimmer drivers.

We truly beleive that BMW cars - especially the older ones were build tough. This is our duty to maintain them right and on time. If you do so the car will pay you back and will run for life.

Here are a couple cars of our happy like-minded customers:

This windshield banner fits pretty much any BMW. It's important to know though that every BMW model has a slight different shape of the windshield. So don't expect the sticker to sit identical on every bimmer.

The sticker is made of an ORACAL vinyl and should last for about 5 years.
