This is the first BMW windshield sticker we ever made. The wording pretty much speaks for itself. Made by bimmer drivers. Made for bimmer drivers.

The idea was pretty random. We decided to try make something bigger rather than generation  stickers. Our designer took a Copic marker and that’s how the sticker was born.
