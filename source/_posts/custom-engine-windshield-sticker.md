BMW company is known for building very reliable and powerful engines. We decided to make a sticker that will let other people know what's under your hood. Personally we think it's a very cool idea. Especially if you say swapped something unusual in your BMW. How about "LS1 Powered" e36 üßê?

Sticker is available in two colors. White one is made of an ORACAL 651 glossy adhesive vinyl. Silver sticker is made of Cricut adhesive silver foil. Durability period is 6 years. Please specify the color you want on the eBay Checkout page or Direct Message us after you place the order. We ship Glossy White if no color is specified.

P.S: our favorite engine is M52. What engine do you like the best? Post in comments below.
